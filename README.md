## About fooditems.
I would *HIGHLY* discourage giving users access to fooditems before im able to add the AntiCheat.
Giving users foo!
ditems before adding the AntiCheat could allow users to ItemSwap, causing havok.

## Example of this is me with makerpen in a reccenter.

But, people can draw much more foul imagery!
